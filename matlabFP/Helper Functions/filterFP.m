%
%   Description: This function allows the user to implement a lowpass or
%   highpass butterworth filter. A butterworth filter was choosen because the passband and stopband are
%   maximally flat. However, the roll-off is broad; you must increase frequency order if you want 
%   a steeper roll-off. This function will also allow the user to visualize the bode
%   plot of the designed filter. Optionally, the function will also allow the
%   user to downsample the signal afterwards.
%
%
%   Input:
%   rawSignal = Unadjusted photometry signal
%   sampleRate = sampling rate used to acquire photometry signal
%   cutoff = Cut off frequency desired by the user
%   order = Desired filter order -- Note: Higher order provides a steeper
%   roll-off
%   filtType = Choose between 'lowpass' or 'highpass'
%   downsamplefactor = Optional final input that allows user to downsample
%   the signal. This optional will also provide the user with the downsampled
%   sampling rate as an additional output
%
%   Output:
%   cleanSignal = filtered signal
%   filt = filter object to present filter/system properties
%   adjustedSamplingRate = Optional output if they user decides to
%   downsample the signal
